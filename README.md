A self-guided frontdoor concierge to walk different people through an admissions process, both for first responders and self-service

## Problem

_Digital Front Doors_
*Problem*: Patients may not know what to do besides showing up to the hospital emergency department when they feel sick. This exposes them, their families, other paitents, and healthcare workers to infection risk adn puts strain on the sytem. *Solution*: Digitize the front-door/admissions workflow of the hospital and put a qualified healthcare professional on the other end of the line (phone, tex, app, etc). Triage to telemedicine consultation, ambulance, or emergency department based on factors like location, accessibility, and insurance coverage.
